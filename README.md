# Pexels + Nextjs

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev # (suggested)
# or
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Todo list

- âœ… Boilerplate with Nextjs + Typescript
- âœ… Connect with Pexels API
- âœ… Navigation with infinite scroll
- âœ… Loading images with default placeholder (blur + default color)
- âœ… Basic styling
- âœ… Deploy to Vercel

## Overview

## Pre-requirements

- An API key for Pexels is required. After generating the key, `.env` should be updated with the proper value for `NEXT_PUBLIC_PEXELS_API_KEY`. Nextjs automatically reads this variable when running in local environment.

### Navigation

1. On first load, to enhance UX, a set of images is prefetched using `getServerSideProps`
2. After scrolling, the `button` for loading more has a `IntersectionObserver` listener to automatically load 10 more images when reached
3. To prevent scrollings ad infinitum, a hard limit of 10 pages is set, so whenever the user exceeds the first 10 pages while scrolling, the `Load more` button needs to be clicked
4. For fetching data in the Client side we are using `react-query` which adds a caching layer on top of `fetch`. This is really convenient when reloading things that might be 

### Styling

For styling, the library used was [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). This brings some advantages:

- CSS Reset by default
- Easily extend CSS Modules
- Support for multiple user preferences by default
  - `prefers-color-scheme`: uses OS local settings
  - `prefers-reduced-motion`: disables hover effects for images

### Image Loading

NextJS Image Optimization strategy is used, but it could also be leveraged on the Pexels API response.

One thing added by the `<Image />` component is to support blur and blurred data while fetching the images form the source, which in addition with a default background color for the image creates a better UX.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
